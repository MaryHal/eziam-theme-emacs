------

*Eziam is not yet usable.  Don't use it*

Eziam is a theme for Emacs.  It is a fork of [[https://github.com/11111000000/tao-theme-emacs][Tao]] with a hint of [[https://github.com/fniessen/emacs-leuven-theme/issues][Leuven]].  Unlike Tao, it tries to keep some very minimal color indications, while remaining mainly grayscale and trying to avoid the “angry fruit salad” syndrome.

It colorizes:

 - org/markdown headings, in a a fashion that should be reminiscent of Leuven.
 - Flycheck/Flyspell indicators and faces.
 - Class/function names at declaration/definition to make code structure easier to scan.

** Screenshots

soon!

** Installation

Eziam is not yet in Melpa.

** What's in a name?

An extremely bad pun.
