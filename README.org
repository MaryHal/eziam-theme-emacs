#+TITLE: Eziam Theme

Eziam is a theme for Emacs, which tries to combine the simplicity of [[https://github.com/11111000000/tao-theme-emacs][Tao]] with the org-mode goodness of [[https://github.com/fniessen/emacs-leuven-theme/issues][Leuven]].  Unlike Tao, keeps some very minimal color indications, while remaining mainly grayscale and trying to avoid the “angry fruit salad” syndrome.  Unlike Leuven, it remains mostly greyscale, with no color for syntax, and easily allows multiple variants.

** Installation

Eziam is not yet in Melpa.

** Configuration

** Design notes

These notes are meant for people who wish to understand the way Eziam is built, either to fork it, or to modify it in a way that can be contributed back to Eziam.

Eziam build script (=make.sh=) uses the [[https://logological.org/gpp][gpp]] preprocessor to apply palette values into a single template file and generate the theme's el files.  Each =*.palette= file corresponds to an Eziam variant, the name of the file will become the name of the variant.  It looks a bit weird, but is in fact super easy (and avoids code duplication, yay!).  A =.palette= files defines constants for the colors (in a fashion reminiscent of the C/C++ preprocessor), and eventually a magic constant called =DARK_MODE=.

| Constant name      | Meaning                                                         |
|--------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| =DARK_MODE=          | ~#define~ only for a dark variant.  Value doesn't matter          |
| =COLOR_0=            | Negative contrast                                               |
| =COLOR_1=            | Background color                                                |
| =COLOR_2= to =COLOR_7= | Should be a set of shades grading from background to foreground |
| COLOR_8            | Default foreground color                                        |

 - =DARK_MODE= :: is used for outlines and a few other places where a dark background should be handled differently than a light one.  First levels of outline uses a colored background with a =COLOR_8= font in light modes, but a =COLOR_0= background with a colored face if =DARK_MODE= is set.
 - =COLOR_0= :: is “even more background than the background”.  In the “light” variant, it is used to get a perfectly white highlight background.  Looks at the various =.palette= files and =eziam-theme.el.tpl= to understand what it does.


** Credits

Eziam is essentially a mix of two remarkable themes, Peter Kosov's [[https://github.com/11111000000/tao-theme-emacs][Tao]] and Fabrice Niessen's [[https://github.com/fniessen/emacs-leuven-theme/issues][Leuven]].  Although it is technically a fork of the former, it also borrows code from the latter, especially the “generic colors” logic and, of course, the great org/markdown outlines.

The name “Eziam” is an extraordinarily bad pun, which I feel like I probably shouldn't explain.  If you don't get it, you're probably OK.
