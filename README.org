# Eziam Theme

Eziam is a theme for Emacs.  It is a fork of [[https://github.com/11111000000/tao-theme-emacs][Tao]] with a touch of [[https://github.com/fniessen/emacs-leuven-theme/issues][Leuven]].  Unlike Tao, it tries to keep some very minimal color indications, while remaining mainly grayscale and avoiding the “angry fruit salad” syndrome.

It colorizes:

 - org/markdown headings, in a a fashion that should be reminiscent of Leuven.
 - Fly[check|spell] indicators and faces.
 - Class/function names at declaration/definition to make code structure easier to scan.

## Installation

Eziam is not yet in Melpa.

## What's in a name?

An extremely bad pun.
